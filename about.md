Developer and musician working out of Oslo, Norway.  I work at
[Amedia Utvikling](http://utvikling.amedia.no/) where my duties
include Ruby, Javascript, Node.js, Docker and lots of other cool
technologies. I love everything
[Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and most things
[*nix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like).

In my spare time I'm a father, dog-walker and bassplayer for
[Execration](http://www.execration.no)
