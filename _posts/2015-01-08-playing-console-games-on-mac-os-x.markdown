This is my first blog-post ever and it will be a very short one. I
love playing classic games, and recently I stumbled upon a fantastic
open-source project called
[OpenEmu](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu). If you enjoy classic
games on say NES, SNES, Atari Lynx, Atari 2600, SEGA and many others
head over to [openemu.org](http://openemu.org/) and install their
brilliant emulator. For extra credits, order a controller from
Retrolink. I got a NES controller from ebay, but they are also
available from [amazon.com](http://amzn.com/B005Y5NO4U). Note that
OpenEmu is OS X only, but there are plenty of similar emulators for
both Linux and Windows.

Stay tuned for my next post!
